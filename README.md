# ARP Flooding Attack Script

This Python script demonstrates how to perform an ARP flooding attack using the `scapy` library. ARP flooding is a type of attack where an attacker sends a large number of ARP requests to a network, causing the ARP tables of devices on the network to become overwhelmed. This can lead to network disruption and denial of service.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the `scapy` library installed. You can install it using pip:

```
pip install scapy
```

## Usage

To perform an ARP flooding attack, run the script from the command line and provide the IP address and the number of MAC addresses to send as arguments. For example:

```
python arp_flood_attack.py 192.168.1.1 100
```

This will perform an ARP flooding attack on the IP address `192.168.1.1` by sending 100 ARP request packets with randomly generated MAC addresses.

## Disclaimer

Please note that performing ARP flooding attacks is illegal and unethical. It can cause significant harm to network infrastructure and disrupt legitimate network traffic. Use this script responsibly and only for educational purposes or in a controlled environment where you have explicit permission to perform such attacks.
